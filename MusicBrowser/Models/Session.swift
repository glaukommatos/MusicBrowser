 This is the model used to represent a session in the UI.

 I'm not sure exactly how I feel about it actually having imageData on it
 directly, but it was convenient to let the `SessionRepository` handle
 image fetching and keep it out of the viewsâ€“ in addition I wanted to
 avoid having to show any placeholders to the user when the data
 is loaded.
